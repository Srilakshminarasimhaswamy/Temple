                        <p class="font-weight-normal">
                            The story of Narasimha as described in the Bhagavata Purana is as follows:
                            In his previous avatara of Varaha, Vishnu killed a rakshasa known as Hiranyaksha. Hiranyaksha's
                            brother Hiranyakashipu, greatly angered by this, started to abhor Lord Vishnu and his followers.
                            To which end he decides to attempt to kill Vishnu by gaining mystical powers, which he believes
                            Brahma, the chief among the devas will award him if he undergoes many years of great austerity
                            and penance. This initially seems to work as planned with Brahma becoming pleased by
                            Hiranyakashipu's austerities. Brahma thus appears before Hiranyakashipu and offers him a boon
                            that he will personally make true anything he wishes for. In reply to which Hiranyakashipu
                            requests the following:</p>
                        <p class="font-italic">"O my lord, O best of the givers of benediction, if you will kindly grant me
                            the benediction I
                            desire, please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you. Grant me
                            that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at night,
                            nor on the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought about by any weapon, nor
                            by any human being or animal. Grant me that I not meet death from any entity, living or
                            nonliving created by you. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any demigod or demon or by
                            any great snake from the lower planets. Since no one can kill you in the battlefield, you have
                            no competitor. Therefore, grant me the benediction that I too may have no rival. Give me sole
                            lordship over all the living entities and presiding deities, and give me all the glories
                            obtained by that position. Furthermore, give me all the mystic powers attained by long
                            austerities and the practice of yoga, for these cannot be lost at any time."
                        </p>

                        <p class="font-weight-normal">
                            One day while Hiranyakashipu is performing austerities at Mandaracala Mountain, his home is
                            attacked by Indra and the other devatas. A great battle ensued, in which the devas were
                            defeated. While fleeing, Indra abducted the pregnant Kayadhu, the wife of Hiranyakashipu, as a
                            spoil of war. At this point the divine sage Narada intervenes to
                            protect Kayadhu, whom he describes as 'sinless'. Following this event, Narada takes Kayadu into
                            his care and while under the guidance of Narada, her unborn child (Hiranyakashipu's son)
                            Prahlada, becomes affected by the transcendental instructions of the sage even at such a young
                            stage of development. Thus, Prahlada later begins to show symptoms of this earlier training by
                            Narada, gradually becoming recognised as a devoted follower of Vishnu, much to his father's
                            disappointment.
                            Hiranyakashipu eventually becomes so angry and upset at his son's devotion to Vishnu (whom he
                            sees as his mortal enemy) that he decides he must kill him,but each time he attempts to kill the
                            boy, Prahlada is protected by Vishnu's mystical power. When asked, Prahlada refuses to
                            acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe and claims that Vishnu is
                            all-pervading and omnipresent. Hiranyakashipu points to a nearby pillar and asks if 'his Vishnu'
                            is in it:
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-italic">
                            "O most unfortunate Prahlada, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme
                            being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But
                            where is He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?"
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">
                            Prahlada then answers, He was, He is and He will be. In an alternate version of the story,
                            Prahlada answers, He is in pillars, and he is in the smallest twig. Hiranyakashipu, unable to
                            control his anger, smashes the pillar with his mace, and following a tumultuous sound, Vishnu in
                            the form of Narasimha appears from it and moves to attack his father in defence of Prahlada. In
                            order to kill Hiranyakashipu and not upset the boon given by Brahma, the form of Narasimha is
                            chosen. Hiranyakashipu can not be killed by human, deva or animal. Narasimha is neither one of
                            these as he is a form of Vishnu incarnate as a part-human, part-animal. He comes upon
                            Hiranyakashipu at twilight (when it is neither day nor night) on the threshold of a courtyard
                            (neither indoors nor out), and puts the demon on his thighs (neither earth nor space). Using his
                            shafingernails (neither animate nor inanimate) as weapons, he disembowels and kills the demon.
                            Kurma Purana describes the preceding battle between the Purusha and demonic forces in which he
                            escapes a powerful weapon called Pashupata and it describes how Prahlada's brothers headed by
                            Anuhrada and thousands of other demons "were led to the valley of death (yamalayam) by the lion
                            produced from the body of man-lion" avatara. The same episode occurs in the Matshya Purana 179,
                            several chapters after its version of the Narasimha advent.

                            The Bhagavata Purana further narrates: even after killing Hiranyakashipu, none of the present
                            demigods are able to calm Narasimha's fury, not even Shiva. So all the gods and goddesses call
                            his consort, Lakshmi, but she is also unable to do so. Then, at the request of Brahma, Prahlada
                            is presented to Narasimha, and finally he is calmed by the prayers of his devotee before
                            parting, Narasimha rewards the wise Prahlada by crowning him as king.
